<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, i'm Ahmad I'm studying web development. i live in scotland and i love
  exploring scotland north as i love nature and i think there is not better
  place than the north. I have been a professional athlete, it was my dream to
  compete on high level but couldn't do it because of injuries.

  Over the last four years I have continuously strived to gain and improve my
  knowledge throughout all aspects of the web. I first studied HTML and CSS
  through a YouTube channel named thenewboston; the tutorials that were provided
  helped to give me a foundation which I could later build upon. Using this
  channel I also went on to gain a basic understanding of programming using the
  C++ and Java programming languages. Once I felt comfortable using HTML, CSS,
  C++ and Java I went on to study from another channel named phpacademy. This
  transition greatly helped improve my knowledge of both PHP and CSS to the
  point where I can now create basic dynamic websites without the aid of
  tutorials. I have been using books to expand my knowledge, the most recent
  being Digital Design for Print and Web. This has greatly improved my ability
  to create aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. My dedication to
  self-improvement in web design and development has inspired me to study web at
  a university, where I hope to incorporate new ideas with my own knowledge in a
  practical and beneficial way, as well as to add work to a future portfolio.
  Over the course of my designing and developing, I have identified several
  areas in which I struggled and have decided, in order to make my transfer to
  university easier, to spend the next year focusing and developing my knowledge
  in those areas by researching and experimenting with new ideas to find a
  practise that is both practical and compliments my style.
